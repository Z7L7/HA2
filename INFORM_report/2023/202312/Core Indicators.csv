All Syrian refugees resident in Iraq are considered in need and members of impacted communities based on the 3RP 2023. 

3RP, doesn’t specify humanitarian conditions level for Syrian refugees. Thus, for humanitarian conditions, CARI 2022 numbers and HNO methodology for FSC humanitarian condition levels were used. Per HNO, “poor consumption” falls into “catastrophic’ and “extreme”, while “borderline consumption” falls into “severe.”

Per CARI and MSNA, 1% of Syrian refugees experience poor consumption while 7% are borderline. For the SI, an adjustment is made to place the 1% who have poor consumption at Level 5, the 7% who have borderline consumption at Level 4, the remaining at Level 3.
