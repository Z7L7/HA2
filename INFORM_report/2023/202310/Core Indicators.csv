INGOs/UN have no access. This number is the latest available information on internally displaced persons (IDPs) because of conflict in west Papua. Previosly the latest information from local observers was 60,000 IDPs by Dec 2021. According to the latest UN source: 'since the escalation of violence in December 2018, the overall number of displaced has grown by 60,000 to 100,000 people. The majority of IDPs have not returned to their homes due to the heavy security force presence and ongoing armed clashes in the conflict areas.” Information on IDP figures in west Papua is not always available on a regular basis, and the UN is considered a reliable source, so although the range is between 60,000 - 100,000, the analyst's interpretation is that the number is likely closer to 100,000 IDPs as this information is newer than the 60,000 IDP figure from Dec 2021.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113062,2023-09-24 00:00:00,IDN002Injuries reported,0,x,x,x,No data available.,x,2023-09-24 00:00:00,IDN002Illness cases reported,x,x,x,x,No/limited data/information available,x,2019-07-30 00:00:00,IDN002Fatalities reported,55,ACLED accessed 16/09/2023,Low,3,"Total number of fatalities in the last 6 months in the Papua and West Papua provinces.
