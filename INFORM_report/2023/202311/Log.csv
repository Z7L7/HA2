","The total number of PIN equals to the sum of the number of people in the country facing moderate or severe chronic food insecurity (except for the Rohingya refugees and host population in the Rohingya refugee crisis); the number of Rohingya refugees as per the latest estimates provided by the Goct. Bangladesh and UNHCR; and the number of host community population as per the JRP 2023.

For districts that have the 2023 acute food insecurity data, IPC acute food insecurity phase 3 (crisis) and phase 4 (emergency) data (May - Sept 2023 projections) were used instead of IPC chronic food insecurity level 3 (moderate) and level 4 (severe) data, respectively. The population in need in the floods crisis in Chattogram and Cyclone Hamoon crisis in Chattogram and Cox's Bazar districts, given their profile, are not added here as they are considered to be facing moderate or severe chronic food insecurity and including them would result in significant double counting.

Therefore, 
PIN = number of people facing moderate or severe chronic food insecurity/crisis or emergency phase acute food insecurity (except Rohingya refugees and host community population in the Rohingya refugees crisis) + number of Rohingya refugees as per the latest estimates provided by the Govt. Bangladesh and UNHCR + number of host community population as per the JRP 2023 = 36,046,398 + 965,467+ 537,900 = 37,549,765

Sources used for the PIN: IPC 15/06/2022, IPC 01/06/2023, ISCG et al. 07/03/2023, latest estimates for the number of Rohingya refugees by the Govt. Bangladesh and the UNHCR

An alternative measure for PIN is people living under the poverty line. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2022 published by the BBS, the poverty rate is 18.7% which is around 32 million people. This figure is also close to the 38 million and is expected to be the case as food insecurity in Bangladesh is a consequence of poverty, especially when food availability itself is not the major factor for food insecurity. However, IPC provides levels/phases that can be used to distribute people in need among severity index severity levels, so IPC data is used for calculation of the PIN.

Complex crisis background:
The complex crisis in Bangladesh is marked by many drivers, including high recurrence of natural hazards such as flash and monsoon floods, cyclones, riverbank erosion, and dry spells; unsustainable livelihoods (unskilled day labour, marginal farming or fishing that often generate inadequate and unpredictable income); low levels of physical, financial, and human capital; vulnerability to shocks and loss of employment, especially in agriculture sector; lack of access to education for the poorest; mistargeting of social safety net programmes due to various issues such as corruption, favouritism, nepotism, and political pressure; post-pandemic situation and the conflict in Ukraine; economic issues such as high food prices, persistent high inflation rates, depreciation of the local currency, and low foreign currency reserves; epidemic (e.g., dengue); and displacement.",BGD010People in Need,2023-12-27,Humanitarian development

As at 6 October 2023, the number of IDPs in the West Papua territory was estimated to be around 76,000 by an international human rights watchdog.

The majority of IDPs have not returned to their homes due to the heavy security force presence and ongoing armed clashes in the conflict areas. Information on IDP figures in West Papua is not always available on a regular basis, and the UN is considered a reliable source, so although the range is between 60,000 - 100,000, the analyst's interpretation is that the number is likely closer to 100,000 IDPs.

Note: Injury figures have been adjusted retroactively by OHCHR in November 2023 and logged retroactively in January 2024. OHCHR states that the actual figures are considerably higher, however because information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed, and other information is still being verified at the time of publication. For example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. The reliability is set as low for this reason. ",UKR002Injuries reported,2023-12-31,Change in the data/methodology
