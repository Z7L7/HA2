According to the latest UN source: 'since the escalation of violence in December 2018, the overall number of displaced has grown by 60,000 to 100,000 people. The majority of IDPs have not returned to their homes due to the heavy security force presence and ongoing armed clashes in the conflict areas.” Information on IDP figures in west Papua is not always available on a regular basis, and the UN is considered a reliable source, so although the range is between 60,000 - 100,000, the analyst's interpretation is that the number is likely closer to 100,000 IDPs as this information is newer than the 60,000 IDP figure from Dec 2021.",IDN002People displaced,2023-07-19,Humanitarian development

All Syrian refugees resident in Iraq are considered in need and members of impacted communities based on the 3RP 2022. 

3RP, doesn’t specify humanitarian conditions level for Syrian refugees. Thus, for humanitarian conditions, CARI 2022 numbers and HNO methodology for FSC humanitarian condition levels were used. Per HNO, “poor consumption” falls into “catastrophic’ and “extreme”, while “borderline consumption” falls into “severe.”

Per CARI and MSNA, 1% of Syrian refugees experience poor consumption while 7% are borderline. For the SI, an adjustment is made to place the 1% who have poor consumption at Level 5, the 7% who have borderline consumption at Level 4, the remaining at Level 3.
