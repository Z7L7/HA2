PHL012 affects the entire country except the Region X, Region XI, and Caraga. 

Therefore, all the regions are affected. So, the people living in all the regions are considered as exposed.

This country level exposed population  figure is less than the aggregate exposed figure for all the individual crises (PHL012 + PHL013). This is because there are overlaps in the regions affected among the crises, i.e., multiple crises affect the same regions. Hence, the issue of mismatch between the country level figure and aggregate figure.
