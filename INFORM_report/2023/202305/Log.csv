The total population is considered facing at least minor humanitarian conditions. The entire population (about 22 m) is considered exposed. All the population are affected and equal to exposed. Therefore, it is zero. 

The entire country got affected. The significant reduction in agricultural production in Sri Lanka has been compounded by the rising prices of fuel and basic food items. The government has forecasted food shortages during the next months (June onwards). Hospitals in the country report shortages of essential medicines and other health items forcing doctors to postpone life-saving procedures amid unprecedented economic crisis. Frequent power outages also affect the delivery of health services and the economy in general. Negative coping mechanisms are threatening the loss of livelihoods, and an observed rise in violence raises protection concerns. Such issues have encompassed all the 25 districts of the country and hence, affecting the entire population. Therefore, no one is considered to be under minimal humanitarian conditions.

According to the latest UN source: 'since the escalation of violence in December 2018, the overall number of displaced has grown by 60,000 to 100,000 people. The majority of IDPs have not returned to their homes due to the heavy security force presence and ongoing armed clashes in the conflict areas.” Information on IDP figures in west Papua is not always available on a regular basis, and the UN is considered a reliable source, so although the range is between 60,000 - 100,000, the analyst's interpretation is that the number is likely closer to 100,000 IDPs as this information is newer than the 60,000 IDP figure from Dec 2021.",IDN002People displaced,2023-05-30,Humanitarian development
