Hospitals in the country report shortages of essential medicines and other health items forcing doctors to postpone life-saving procedures amid unprecedented economic crisis. Frequent power outages also affect the delivery of health services and the economy in general. Negative coping mechanisms are threatening the loss of livelihoods, and an observed rise in violence raises protection concerns.

This country level exposed population  figure is less than the aggregate exposed figure for all the individual crises (PHL003 + PHL012 + PHL013).

This includes all people exposed to the conflict, which is considered to be the entire population of Rakhine state and Paletwa township in Chin state, minus those directly affected or people in need (2,318,411). In Bangladesh, there is no population that is simply considered to be only exposed. Level 2 includes all people directly affected by the conflict in Rakhine / Rohingya refugee influx. In Rakhine, this is the population of townships where PIN are located (805,162 people). This is based on the assumption that anyone living in townships where there are PIN is likely to be experience direct humanitarian consequences from the conflict.  In Bangladesh, this number includes the host population (471,768). The host population in Cox’s Bazar is considered to be affected by the influx of Rohingya that occurred after September 2017. The PIN includes all people in need in Rakhine state and all Rohingya refugees. In Rakhine, the PIN is calculated using HNO severity data. Level 3 includes all PIN considered to be in stressed and severe conditions (HNO level 2 and 3). In Bangladesh, this includes all refugees that are not classified as particularly vulnerable or experiencing additional needs (647,549). Level 4 in Rakhine includes all those placed in level 4 severity in the HNO as it is considered equal to ACAPS severity methodolody. Level 4 in Bangladesh includes vulnerable populations of refugees (207,246). According to Multi-Sector Needs Assessments from the ISCG, the Joint Humanitarian Response Plan, Settlement and Protection Profiling by UNHCR and REACH, and ACAPS’ analysis on vulnerability within Rohingya camps, there are specific groups that are more likely to face additional challenges in accessing humanitarian assistance. These groups include those living in female-headed households, elderly, unaccompanied or separated children, and individuals with a physical disability. Challenges include physically accessing food distribution, medical care, or income-generating opportunities (social hierarchies, hilly and unstable terrain, long distances), as well as increased risk of security incidents such as robbery or assault – particularly in Teknaf camps. Thus, this population is classified as Level 4 as they are assumed to have a more severe need than other groups within the camp population. According to the new HNO 2021, 150,000 non-displaced Rohingya in Rakhine are facing extreme humanitarian needs.

    Based on the 2022 HNO, the severity was divided into five levels: Level-1
  13% of the PiN (minimal), Level-2 14% of the PiN (stress), Level-3 33% of the
  PiN (severe), Level-4 23% of the PiN (extreme), and Level-5 17% of the PiN

  Extreme into SI level 4 and Catastrophic into SI level 5.
