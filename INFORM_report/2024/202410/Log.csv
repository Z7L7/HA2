This is a general estimation which does not reflect the specific access challenges per district or distinguish between different categories of migrants and refugees in need. The usage of OCHA level 4 and 5 for restricted access constraints and level 2 and 3 for limited access constraint is also an attempt to translate OCHA's 5 severity levels into ACAPS' two  categories. For these reasons, reliability is set as low for both access indicators as the above figures are most likely an overestimation and no specific figure for migrants and refugees in need affected by access constraints was found.",LBY002People facing limited access constraints,2020-07-03,Humanitarian development

The SADC PIN figure was considered but it is lower than the WFP figure (2.2M), without further detail on the source or the calculation method. This is why WFP hotspot analysis was favored in this specific case. The figure corresponds to people projected to experience IPC3 or above levels of food insecurity through 2024. Indeed, the increase reflects a change of source and the geographic expansion of the drought crisis in southern Angola crisis. Given that there has been no IPC analysis since 2021, we were always looking for new sources to update the PIN for this crisis. Two potential sources (SADC appeal and WFP Southern Africa drought hotspot analysis) were recently published, and it is between these two that a choice was made.
The SADC appeal indicates 1.8M experiencing IPC3+ levels in the country (while not being precise on the period considered) while WFP indicates 2.8 million people expected to be in acute food insecurity in southern Angola after the 2024 harvest.
While for the SADC report we were unable to explain the methodology, the WFP figure comes from the combination of their estimate of the ‘Vulnerable Population’ (which is the latest IPC figure) and Drought Affected people. Thus, we had two sources of information, one of which lacked details while the other seemed more precise in terms of the area concerned and the methodology for estimating people in need. The choice therefore fell on the WFP Southern Africa Drought Hotspot Analysis.
The SADC, however, remains a source used for other crises mainly because there are no more recent and more detailed alternative sources.

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, the entire country is considered to be the affected area,

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ",MMR001Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,2024-08-21,Humanitarian development

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, Rakhine state is considered to be the affected state.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ",MMR003Moderate humanitarian conditions - Level 3,2024-08-21,Humanitarian development

For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ",MMR004Moderate humanitarian conditions - Level 3,2024-08-21,Humanitarian development

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, all the states/regions are considered, except Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan (North) states whcih are considered in the pre-coup crises - MMR002 and MMR003. This is done to avoid double counting.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, the entire country is considered to be the affected area,

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

The PIN figure for monsoon floods (MMR006) is added to the estimated PIN from HNO 2023 and HNRP 2024 to get the final PIN (18,591,000 + 75,000 = 18,666,000)",MMR001People in Need,2024-09-25,Change in the data/methodology

Based on the evolution of the crisis, it is reasonable to assume that there are no people in Level 1 anymore. All the people who are not people in need are considered to be in Level 2. So, the Level 2 figure for each state/region is computed by subtracting the PIN figure from the population of each state. Formula: Level 2 = Population – PIN. Population figures for each state/region are obtained from HNO 2023 as HNRP 2024 does not provide those figures.

People affected by floods are already in Level 2 or above in other conflict related crises. So, they are not added to this figure to avoid double counting. As per the context, people in Level 3 for the monsoon flood crisis (MMR006) were already in Level 2, so the Level 3 figure (75,000) of MMR006 is deducted from the Level 2 figure obtained from HNO 2023 and HNRP 2024 for MMR001 .",MMR001Stressed humanitarian conditions - Level 2,2024-09-25,Change in the data/methodology

Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

The Level 3 figure for monsoon floods (MMR006) is added to the estimated Level 3 from HNO 2023 and HNRP 2024 to get the final Level 3 (13,477,830 + 75,000 = 13,552,830)",MMR001Moderate humanitarian conditions - Level 3,2024-09-25,Change in the data/methodology

The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

This crisis now covers 6 provinces, up from 3, and Balochistan province remains the most affected. 
For estimating the number of people affected, we considered the number of people living below the poverty line (World Bank data), across Pakistan.

There is a lack of updated information on population. Since the 2011 census in India, several administrative divisions (including states and districts) have undergone changes and new administrative divisions (states and districts) have been created.

The figure is according to OCHA's 2023 Overview, as it seems the most indicative number for the PiN after reviewing many other sources such as the IPC analysis and the World Bank reports. The breakdown of the severity by area provided by OCHA is not used for this crisis, as it does not reflect the impact of the conflict crisis that has taken place in southern Lebanon. Only the overall PiN figure is considered. Though the IPC analysis provides a good breakdown of the food security needs in the projected period of April – September 2024, ACAPS decided not to include it in the severity index breakdown as it is not indicative of the people's most reported needs according to OCHA which are social stability, health, and energy. If we were to use the IPC analysis, the number of people in need would be only 1.14 million, which is the number of people facing IPC Phase 3 and above. Additionally, the IPC analysis suggests an improvement in the food security situation between April–September in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This does not reflect the overall situation in the country. OCHA projects that the overall humanitarian situation is not expected to improve in Lebanon until after 2025. As for the World Bank report published in May 2024, it captures poverty rates until only 2022, where 44% of the population (2.4 million) have fallen under the poverty line.

According to REACH assessment, 1% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 0.5% had poor FCS with no sever HHS and are placed at L4, no sever HHS and 0% at L5.

This is a significant change from April numbers due to change of methodology and sources that depended on the last issued HNO in 2022.

as well as host community (UNHCR 23/03/2021, p.10) in extreme (Level 5), sever (Level 4), and moderate (Level 3) humanitarian conditions

The host community was included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

Food Consumption Score (FCS) were used to determine the level of humanitarian conditions. REACH MSNA VI of Syrian Refugees and Host Communities in Iraq (March 2022) was used for this purpose.

Based on HNO methodology, Borderline consumption FCS 28.5> - > 42.5 (regardless of HHS score) are placed on L3, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 are placed at L4, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 and sever HHS at L5.

According to REACH assessment for refugees, 7% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 1% had poor FCS and are placed at L4. No sever HHS is assumed and 0% are placed at L5. For host community, 1% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 0% had poor FCS so L4 & L5 are considered 0%.

The conflict has also contributed to the deterioration of the country’s economy, especially from late 2019 as a result of the combined impacts of US sanctions, COVID-19, and the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon.

The three major earthquakes that hit southeastern Türkiye and northwestern Syria in February 2023, affecting 8.8 million people in Syria alone, aggravating the existing humanitarian crisis. Further collapse of the Syrian Lira and suspension of WFP food distribution further contributed to both the increase of number of PiN and the severity of humanitarian conditions. The security situation in Syria witnessed significant deterioration in the past year as well.

This approach assumes that the whole population in a certain analysis unit is at the same level of severity. 

The remaining PiN that are not in Level 5 or Level 4 were assigned to Level 3. This is the same number as PiN in the 162 subdistricts that had a severity categorization of “Sever” at Level 3 in addition to the two subdistricts at “Stressed” Level 2. The PiN in those districts were assigned to Level 3. 

“The Distribution of People in Need by Governorate and Severity by Sub-District” map on page 39 in HNO 2024 was used to allocate those sub districts. 

Even though HNO 2024 provide severity level per sub districts, it doesn’t provide the number of PiN within those sub districts. Instead, HNO 2024 provides PiN per governorate. 

To estimate the PiN per sub district, the Food Security PiN per sub district that is provided by the Food Security Cluster was used to extrapolate those numbers.

This is done by taking the percentage of Food Security PiN for each sub district out of the whole governorate, then multiply this percentage by the PiN per governorate provided by HNO 2024 to get an estimate of PiN for each sub district.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%). Thus, the PiN estimate for “Atareb” will be 6.706% of the 3,505,148 PiN in Aleppo, which equals 234,844, which will all be placed at Level 4.

The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit and assume the multisectorial PiN per sub district is proportional to the Food Security PiN. Furthermore, this approach risks creating a disproportionally high Level 3 and skewing the distribution.

The new methodology for 2024 decreased Level 3 from 50.8% to 36.6%, mainly from people moving from Level 3 to Level 4.

Syrian refugee crisis:
People in need are Syrian refugees as well as host community in extreme (Level 5), sever (Level 4), and moderate (Level 3) humanitarian conditions. 

The host community is included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

PiN and severity figures are multi-sectoral and equal L5 + L4 + L3

There is around 3,332,896 Syrian refugees in Turkiye according to 3RP. According to IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% of the refugees are in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% of the refugees are in Extreme Level (L4); 39% of the refugees are in Sever Level (L3), 41% of the refugees are in stressed Level (L2), and 2% of the refugees are in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are around 3,607,620 according to 3RP. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023. All 14.4% have been placed at Level 3.

As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 315,702 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to IOM.

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (341,725) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis.

There is around 315,702 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to IOM. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (341,725) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023. All 14.4% have been placed at Level 3.
