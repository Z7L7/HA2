People affected is calculated according to such estimations (8.4 million plus 2.9 million). In addition to this, in this figure is also taken the total number of people affected by Venezuelan migration (14 976 405). ""To estimate the total number of people affected we are using the population of cities were at least 100,000 Venezuelans live permanently. The cut-off of 100,000 is made by copying the highest level that Migración Colombia has for August 2023. The total population is taken from the DANE Colombia projection for 2024 (Open Excel document in the link provided called poblacion municipal por area, 2020-2035).

In this case, it would be the cities of (including the national capital): Bogotá D.C (7,929,539), Medellín (2,616,335), Cúcuta (812176), Barranquilla (1,334,509) and Cali (2,283,846), resulting in 14,976,405 affected. 

The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

Based on HNO methodology, Borderline consumption FCS 28.5> - > 42.5 (regardless of HHS score) are placed on L3, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 are placed at L4, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 and sever HHS at L5.

According to REACH assessment for refugees, 7% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 1% had poor FCS and are placed at L4. No sever HHS is assumed and 0% are placed at L5. For host community, 1% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 0% had poor FCS so L4 & L5 are considered 0%.

This is a significant change from April numbers due to change of methodology and sources that depended on the last issued HNO in 2022. These changes are in alignment of the new development in the country. Iraq witnessed a significant improvement in the security situation and economic situation. The defeat of ISIS in 2019 and the elections of 2021, coupled with sufficient state revenue in 2022 and 2023 from oil exports, improved political stability in the country and allowed the Government to enhance basic service delivery.","This field is a concatenation of IRQ002 and IRQ003:

For the Syrian refugees SI levels, an adjustment is made to place the 0% at Level 5, the 2% who severely food insecure at Level 4, 61% who are moderately food insecure at Level 3. 

For the host community in need, UNHCR's 3RP 2023 numbers were used instead of 3RP 2024, as 3RP 2024 shows a significant jump in the number of host community in need with no explanation for the change in numbers (2,700,000 compared to 520,000). Latest developments do not support the unexplained significant jump in 3RP 2024 and as such 3RP 2023 number for host community was used instead. Per 3RP 2023, 520,000 million of the host communities are in need, and all of them conservatively were placed at Level 3 as there are no reliable assessments on their humanitarian conditions.

For this crisis, the entire country is considered to be the affected area,

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

",2024-06-27 00:00:00,MMR001Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,5113000,OCHA 15/01/2023; OCHA 18/12/2023 b,Medium ,2,"PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, the entire country is considered to be the affected area,

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

",2024-06-27 00:00:00,MMR002Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,1242000,OCHA 15/01/2023; OCHA 18/12/2023 b,Medium ,2,"PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, Rakhine state is considered to be the affected state.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well.

For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000.

Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%.

Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

",2024-06-27 00:00:00,MMR004Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,3492000,OCHA 15/01/2023; OCHA 18/12/2023 b,Medium ,2,"PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, all the states/regions are considered, except Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan (North) states whcih are considered in the pre-coup crises - MMR002 and MMR003. This is done to avoid double counting.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

This is an increase of IDP population by 56.59% comapred to August 2022. Although the figure is old, media reports seem to indicate the violence and conflict have resultied in displacement in 2023 and 2024 but the exact figure of the number of IDPs is unknown. 

It is to be noted that the IOM DTM in a report published in March 2024 showed that around 25,500 people are displaced in the Enga province due to violence and conflict. It is highly likely that other provinces in the Highlands region have IDPs as well. So, the IOM data of December 2022 is still used for the displacement figure.

This approach assumes that the whole population in a certain analysis unit is at the same level of severity. 

The remaining PiN that are not in Level 5 or Level 4 were assigned to Level 3. This is the same number as PiN in the 162 subdistricts that had a severity categorization of “Sever” at Level 3 in addition to the two subdistricts at “Stressed” Level 2. The PiN in those districts were assigned to Level 3. 

“The Distribution of People in Need by Governorate and Severity by Sub-District” map on page 39 in HNO 2024 was used to allocate those sub districts. 

Even though HNO 2024 provide severity level per sub districts, it doesn’t provide the number of PiN within those sub districts. Instead, HNO 2024 provides PiN per governorate. 

To estimate the PiN per sub district, the Food Security PiN per sub district that is provided by the Food Security Cluster was used to extrapolate those numbers.

This is done by taking the percentage of Food Security PiN for each sub district out of the whole governorate, then multiply this percentage by the PiN per governorate provided by HNO 2024 to get an estimate of PiN for each sub district.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%). Thus, the PiN estimate for “Atareb” will be 6.706% of the 3,505,148 PiN in Aleppo, which equals 234,844, which will all be placed at Level 4.

The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit and assume the multisectorial PiN per sub district is proportional to the Food Security PiN. Furthermore, this approach risks creating a disproportionally high Level 3 and skewing the distribution.

As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 320,000 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to 3RP. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (346,377) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023.

The host community is included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

There are no reliable estimate for the severity levels for the mixed migrants in Turkiye. We assume the conditions for the mixed migration in Turkkiye are similar somehow to that of the Syrian refugees. As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 320,000 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to 3RP. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (346,377) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023. All 14.4% have been placed at Level 3.

The figure was calculated by using the number of people in need from HNRP 2024 and the percentage numbers of the severity levels from HNO 2023, as the situation in Ukraine in 2024 is considered to be relatively similar to 2023.
In HNO 2023, the the humanitarian needs are broken down into five severity levels of need; minimal, stressed, severe, extreme, and catastrophic. The percentages of the severity levels as per HNO 2023 were: minimal (0%), stressed (13%), severe (52%), extreme (8%), and catastrophic (27%). However, in HNRP 2024, there are no percentages provided for those severity levels, therefore, the percentages used to calculate level 3 in 2024 are the same percentages from HNO 2023.
As per the INFORM severity methodology, the sum of people in need from the minimal, stressed, and severe levels in HNO2023 are equivalent to the moderate humanitarian conditions level 3: minimal (0%) + stressed (13%) + severe (52%) = 65%
The number of PIN in Level 3 in 2023 was calculated as following: 65% of the total PIN in HNO 2023).
The calculation in 2024 uses the same percentage (65%) as following:
