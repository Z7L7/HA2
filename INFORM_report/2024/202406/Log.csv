People affected is calculated according to such estimations (8.4 million plus 2.9 million). In addition to this, in this figure is also taken the total number of people affected by Venezuelan migration (14 976 405). ""To estimate the total number of people affected we are using the population of cities were at least 100,000 Venezuelans live permanently. The cut-off of 100,000 is made by copying the highest level that Migración Colombia has for August 2023. The total population is taken from the DANE Colombia projection for 2024 (Open Excel document in the link provided called poblacion municipal por area, 2020-2035).

In this case, it would be the cities of (including the national capital): Bogotá D.C (7,929,539), Medellín (2,616,335), Cúcuta (812176), Barranquilla (1,334,509) and Cali (2,283,846), resulting in 14,976,405 affected. 

The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

The needs are driven by the conflict that has been going since 2011 and has led to one of the largest displacement crises in the world. The conflict has also contributed to the deterioration of the country’s economy, especially from late 2019 as a result of the combined impacts of US sanctions, COVID-19, and the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon.

The three major earthquakes that hit southeastern Türkiye and northwestern Syria in February 2023, affecting 8.8 million people in Syria alone, aggravating the existing humanitarian crisis.

This approach assumes that the whole population in a certain analysis unit is at the same level of severity. 

The remaining PiN that are not in Level 5 or Level 4 were assigned to Level 3. This is the same number as PiN in the 162 subdistricts that had a severity categorization of “Sever” at Level 3 in addition to the two subdistricts at “Stressed” Level 2. The PiN in those districts were assigned to Level 3. 

“The Distribution of People in Need by Governorate and Severity by Sub-District” map on page 39 in HNO 2024 was used to allocate those sub districts. 

Even though HNO 2024 provide severity level per sub districts, it doesn’t provide the number of PiN within those sub districts. Instead, HNO 2024 provides PiN per governorate. 

To estimate the PiN per sub district, the Food Security PiN per sub district that is provided by the Food Security Cluster was used to extrapolate those numbers.

This is done by taking the percentage of Food Security PiN for each sub district out of the whole governorate, then multiply this percentage by the PiN per governorate provided by HNO 2024 to get an estimate of PiN for each sub district.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%). Thus, the PiN estimate for “Atareb” will be 6.706% of the 3,505,148 PiN in Aleppo, which equals 234,844, which will all be placed at Level 4.

The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit and assume the multisectorial PiN per sub district is proportional to the Food Security PiN. Furthermore, this approach risks creating a disproportionally high Level 3 and skewing the distribution.

The new methodology for 2024 decreased Level 3 from 50.8% to 36.6%, mainly from people moving from Level 3 to Level 4.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%). Thus, the PiN estimate for “Atareb” will be 6.706% of the 3,505,148 PiN in Aleppo, which equals 234,844, which will all be placed at Level 4.

The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit and assume the multisectorial PiN per sub district is proportional to the Food Security PiN. Furthermore, this approach risks creating a disproportionally high Level 3 and skewing the distribution.

The new methodology for 2024 decreased Level 3 from 50.8% to 36.6%, mainly from people moving from Level 3 to Level 4. This is in alignment with the new developments of the deteriorating conditions in Syria, including deterioration in security, economy as well the impact of the earthquakes.",SYR001Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,2024-05-25,Change in the data/methodology

Syrian refugee crisis:
People in need are Syrian refugees as well as host community in extreme (Level 5), sever (Level 4), and moderate (Level 3) humanitarian conditions. 

The host community is included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

PiN and severity figures are multi-sectoral and equal L5 + L4 + L3

There is around 3,332,896 Syrian refugees in Turkiye according to 3RP. According to IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% of the refugees are in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% of the refugees are in Extreme Level (L4); 39% of the refugees are in Sever Level (L3), 41% of the refugees are in stressed Level (L2), and 2% of the refugees are in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are around 3,607,620 according to 3RP. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023. All 14.4% have been placed at Level 3.

Mixed migration crisis:
People in need are mixed migrants as well as host community in extreme (Level 5), sever (Level 4), and moderate (Level 3) humanitarian conditions.

There are no reliable estimate for the severity levels for the mixed migrants in Turkiye. We assume the conditions for the mixed migration in Turkkiye are similar somehow to that of the Syrian refugees. As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 320,000 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to 3RP. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (346,377) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023.

Kurdish conflict crisis:
The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the kurdish conflict is unknown, but expected to be high. Affected regions of southeastern Turkey have been subjected to decades of violence, which has deeply affected many aspects of life. Large numbers of people remain in a situation of protracted displacement, though their specific needs are not known.

Earthquake crisis:
Low reliability estimation using food security indicator was used. For PiN, the people targeted for food assistance activities by WFP for the EQ response was used as a proxy for PiN. All have been placed on Level three as a conservative estimate for the lack of reliable assessments on the humanitarian conditions and people of needs specifically for people displaced by the earthquake. These needs are driven by the impact of the earthquakes, which affecting over nine million people and causing humanitarian needs. The earthquakes killed over 50,000 people, injured more than 107,000, and severely damaged buildings and infrastructure in southeastern Türkiye.

The host community is included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

There are no reliable estimate for the severity levels for the mixed migrants in Turkiye. We assume the conditions for the mixed migration in Turkkiye are similar somehow to that of the Syrian refugees. As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 320,000 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to 3RP. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, the entire country is considered to be the affected area,

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ",MMR001People in Need,2024-06-27,Change in the data/methodology

In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ",MMR001Moderate humanitarian conditions - Level 3,2024-06-27,Change in the data/methodology

For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ",MMR002Moderate humanitarian conditions - Level 3,2024-06-27,Change in the data/methodology

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, Rakhine state is considered to be the affected state.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, the states considered are Kachin and Shan (North) states as they are the affected states.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ",MMR004Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,2024-06-27,Change in the data/methodology

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, all the states/regions are considered, except Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan (North) states whcih are considered in the pre-coup crises - MMR002 and MMR003. This is done to avoid double counting.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5).

The breakdown of the severity by area provided by OCHA is not used for this crisis, as it does not reflect the impact of the conflict crisis that has taken place in southern Lebanon. Only the overall PiN figure is considered. Though the IPC analysis provides a good breakdown of the food security needs in the projected period of April – September 2024, ACAPS decided not to include it in the severity index breakdown as it is not indicative of the people's most reported needs according to OCHA which are social stability, health, and energy. If we were to use the IPC analysis, the number of people in need would be only 1.14 million, which is the number of people facing IPC Phase 3 and above. Additionally, the IPC analysis suggests an improvement in the food security situation between April–September in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This does not reflect the overall situation in the country. OCHA projects that the overall humanitarian situation is not expected to improve in Lebanon until after 2025.

For example, the number of people in need in Um Durman, Khartoum is 172,007 according to OCHA's HNRP 2024. Um Durman's severity is assigned as 5 according to JIAF dashboard. The number of people facing extreme humanitarian conditions or in Level 5 is the total of the PiN of admin 2 that are assigned as 5 by JIAF (3,587,894 people). In the OCHA HNO 2023, the totoal number of people in level 5 was 5,228,000 people. There is an increase in the number of people in Level 4 and a decrease in the number of people in Level 5, while the overall PiN is almost the same between the HRP in 2023 and the HNRP in 2024.
Food needs are reported to be the most priority need, with 17.7 million in IPC Phase 3 and above (and 19.3 million who need food security and livelihood according to OCHA). However, the latest IPC analysis was not considered by ACAPS as an alternative source to represent the PiN in the INFORM severity index, as it only considers food needs. Other needs such WASH and health are also nearly as high (18.9 million people need WASH and 14.7 million people need health services). Additionally, the latest IPC analysis provides only projections for the period October 2023 – February 2024, based on analysis completed in December 2023. There is lack of evidence on food security needs in the regions most impacted by the conflict, mainly due to the very high access restrictions that prevent conducting IPC analysis there. Those regions are Greater Darfur, Khartoum, and Greater Kordofan States. ",SDN001Extreme humanitarian conditions - Level 5,2024-06-30,Humanitarian development

People in need are displaced people due conflict in extreme (Level 5), sever (Level 4), and moderate (Level 3) humanitarian conditions. Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Household Hunger Score (HHS) were used to determine the level of humanitarian conditions. REACH Cross-Cutting Needs Assessment (CCNA) Key Multi-Sectoral Findings (January 2024) for this purpose. 

Based on HNO methodology, Borderline consumption FCS 28.5> - > 42.5 (regardless of HHS score) are placed on L3, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 are placed at L4, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 and sever HHS at L5.

People in need are Syrian and Palestinian refugees as well as host community in extreme (Level 5), sever (Level 4), and moderate (Level 3) humanitarian conditions. 

The host community was included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

Food Consumption Score (FCS) were used to determine the level of humanitarian conditions. REACH MSNA VI of Syrian Refugees and Host Communities in Iraq (March 2022) was used for this purpose.

Based on HNO methodology, Borderline consumption FCS 28.5> - > 42.5 (regardless of HHS score) are placed on L3, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 are placed at L4, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 and sever HHS at L5.

According to REACH assessment for refugees, 7% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 1% had poor FCS and are placed at L4. No sever HHS is assumed and 0% are placed at L5. For host community, 1% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 0% had poor FCS so L4 & L5 are considered 0%.
