The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

The data for the exposed population is old (2011 census figures), however, based on the understanding of the context, it should not result in overestimation.

Regarding sources:
There is a lack of updated information on population. Since the 2011 census in India, several administrative divisions (including states and districts) have undergone changes and new administrative divisions (states and districts) have been created. These changes made it difficult to collect data on landmass and population, especially at a district level.Also, many documents and websites were found to be not accessible. ACAPS staff chose the sources they found to be the best for the purpose and cross-checked information/data provided in the selected sources.

Tripura:
Sphere India 06/09/2024 reported that around 38,000 families or 149,000 people were displaced (of whom many later returned home) in Tripura due to the floods. So, the estimated average household size = 149,000/38,000 = 3.92.

The number of affected people in Tripura is calculated by number of houses damaged or destroyed (reported by Sphere India 06/09/2024) x average household size for Tripura (using the latest available figure which is for 2019) = 56,666 x 3.92 = around 220,000.


Telangana and Andhra Pradesh:
As per Sphere India 09/09/2024, around 820,000 people were affected.

Total affected population:
The total affected population = 220,000 + 820,000 = 1,040,000.

Based on the understanding of the context, the estimated affected population figure could be an overestimate as a portion of the affected population in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh is likely facing none/minimal humanitarian conditions, hence they might actually be exposed and not affected.","https://reliefweb.int/report/india/tripura-floods-and-landslides-joint-rapid-needs-assessment-september-2024

For this crisis, the entire country is considered to be the affected area,

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

The Level 3 figure for monsoon floods (MMR006) is added to the estimated Level 3 from HNO 2023 and HNRP 2024 to get the final Level 3 (13,477,830 + 75,000 = 13,552,830)","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

Population figures for each state/region are obtained from HNO 2023 as HNRP 2024 does not provide those figures.

People affected by floods are already in Level 2 or above in other conflict related crises. So, they are not added to this figure to avoid double counting.

It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

The Level 3 figure for monsoon floods (MMR006) is added to the estimated Level 3 from HNO 2023 and HNRP 2024 to get the final Level 3 (13,477,830 + 75,000 = 13,552,830)","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

",2024-08-21 00:00:00,MMR002Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,1242000,OCHA 15/01/2023; OCHA 18/12/2023 b,Medium ,2,"PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, Rakhine state is considered to be the affected state.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.


Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

",2024-08-21 00:00:00,MMR003Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,379000,OCHA 15/01/2023; OCHA 18/12/2023 b,Medium ,2,"PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, the states considered are Kachin and Shan (North) states as they are the affected states.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. ","https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-overview-2023-january-2023

",2024-08-21 00:00:00,MMR004Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,3492000,OCHA 15/01/2023; OCHA 18/12/2023 b,Medium ,2,"PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, all the states/regions are considered, except Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan (North) states whcih are considered in the pre-coup crises - MMR002 and MMR003. This is done to avoid double counting.

Reasons for using the total PIN figure from HNRP 2024 and share of phases in PIN from HNO 2023: 
In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases, PIN = Minimal (phase 1) + Stress (phase 2) + Severe (phase 3) + Extreme (phase 4) + Catastrophic (phase 5). In the INFORM Severity Index (SI), PIN = Moderate (level 3) + Severe (level 4) + Extreme (level 5). In case of HNO 2023, SI’s Moderate (level 3) = HNO’s Severe (phase 3), SI’s Severe (level 4) = HNO’s Extreme (phase 4), and SI’s Extreme (level 5) = HNO’s Catastrophic (phase 5). The PIN distribution in HNO 2023 corresponded well to SI's humanitarian conditions. PIN distribution in HNRP 2024 does not match the distribution of PIN in SI.

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, HNRP 2024's total and state/region level PIN figures are considered for SI. 

Calculation:
The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the INFORM Severity Index (SI) humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023). There were no people in the Catastrophic phase in HNO 2023, but given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443.

For estimating the number of people affected, we considered the number of people living below the poverty line (World Bank data), across Pakistan.

Reliable assessments on the severity following in West Bank 7 October 2024 are not available, thus, we are using the same breakdowns of PiN provided by HNO 2023.

PiN and severity figures are multi-sectoral and equal L5 + L4 + L3

According to 2023 Inter-Sector Need Severity Classification: 
1% of the total population are in Catastrophic Level (L5) or 4% of the 0.8m PiN; 3% of the total population are in Extreme Level (L4) or 12% of the 0.8m PiN; 21% of the total population are in Sever Level (L5) or 84% of the 0.8m PiN.
---
50% of the total population are in Stressed Level (L2) or 66.6% of the 2.4m People not in Need; 25% of the total population are in Stressed Level (L2) or 33.3% of the 2.4m People not in Need. 
 ---
1,000,000 is the projection of PiN in the West Bank by OCHA Flash Appeal. As such, 4% of the 1m  PiN are in Catastrophic Level (L5) , 12% of the 1m  PiN are in Extreme Level (L4), 84% of the 1m  PiN are in Sever Level (L4)
---
2,200,000 is the projection of People not in Need in the West Bank by OCHA Flash Appeal. As such, 466.6% of the 2.2m  People not in N are in Stressed Level (L2) , 33.3% of the 2.2m  PiN are in Minimal Level (L1).

For example, the number of people in need in Al Hasahisa, Aj Jazirah state is 269,705 according to OCHA's HNRP 2024. Al Hasahisa's severity is assigned as 3 according to JIAF dashboard. The number of people facing moderate humanitarian conditions or in Level 3 is the total of the PiN of admin 2 that are assigned as 3 by JIAF (10,546,855 people). Compared to OCHA's HRP (May 2023), the total number of people in level 5 was 10,485,000 people. The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit. 
Food needs are reported to be the most priority need, with 25.5 million in IPC Phase 3 and above between June - September 2024, according to IPC projections, and 19.3 million who need food security and livelihood according to OCHA. However, the latest IPC analysis was not considered by ACAPS as an alternative source to represent the PiN in the INFORM severity index, as it only considers food needs. Other needs such WASH and health are also high (18.9 million people need WASH and 14.7 million people need health services). The PiN breakdown using OCHA's figures is more comprehensive of all needs. Additionally, if ACAPS follows the IPC breakdown for June-September 2024, we will also need to follow the breakdown for the third projection period October 2024 - February 2025, which suggests an improvement on the food insecurity levels (from 25.5 million down to 21 million in IPC Phase 3+). However, the humanitarian situation in Sudan is unlikely to improve in October 2024, and the drop in the PiN figure cannot be reasonably explained. Lastly, if ACAPS considers adding the PiN breakdown from the latest IPC projection to the OCHA breakdown, we will most likely double count people in need of food assistance (by referencing both OCHA and IPC).",https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/sudansituation ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-revised-humanitarian-response-plan-2023-revision-issued-17-may-2023-enar; https://data.unhcr.org/en/country/sdn ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-summary-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-and-regional-refugee-response-plan-february-2024 ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-summary-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-and-regional-refugee-response-plan-february-2024 ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-2024-december-2023 ; https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jiaf.helpdesk/viz/Sudan-JIAF2024/Story1?publish=yes ; https://data.humdata.org/dataset/sudan-humanitarian-needs,2024-09-25 00:00:00,SDN001Minimal humanitarian conditions - Level 1,0,OCHA 21/12/2023 ; OCHA JIAF accessed 10/08/2024 ; OCHA HDX accessed 15/04/2024,Medium ,2,"According to INFORM severity index methodology, the number of people facing Minimal humanitarian conditions or in Level 1= People exposed - People affected.

Compared to OCHA's HRP (May 2023), the total number of people in level 5 was 10,485,000 people. The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit. 
Food needs are reported to be the most priority need, with 25.5 million in IPC Phase 3 and above between June - September 2024, according to IPC projections, and 19.3 million who need food security and livelihood according to OCHA. However, the latest IPC analysis was not considered by ACAPS as an alternative source to represent the PiN in the INFORM severity index, as it only considers food needs. Other needs such WASH and health are also high (18.9 million people need WASH and 14.7 million people need health services). The PiN breakdown using OCHA's figures is more comprehensive of all needs. Additionally, if ACAPS follows the IPC breakdown for June-September 2024, we will also need to follow the breakdown for the third projection period October 2024 - February 2025, which suggests an improvement on the food insecurity levels (from 25.5 million down to 21 million in IPC Phase 3+). However, the humanitarian situation in Sudan is unlikely to improve in October 2024, and the drop in the PiN figure cannot be reasonably explained. Lastly, if ACAPS considers adding the PiN breakdown from the latest IPC projection to the OCHA breakdown, we will most likely double count people in need of food assistance (by referencing both OCHA and IPC).",https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/sudansituation ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-revised-humanitarian-response-plan-2023-revision-issued-17-may-2023-enar; https://data.unhcr.org/en/country/sdn ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-summary-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-and-regional-refugee-response-plan-february-2024 ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-summary-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-and-regional-refugee-response-plan-february-2024 ; https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-2024-december-2023 ; https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jiaf.helpdesk/viz/Sudan-JIAF2024/Story1?publish=yes ; https://data.humdata.org/dataset/sudan-humanitarian-needs,2024-09-25 00:00:00,SDN001Severe humanitarian conditions - Level 4,10651000,OCHA 21/12/2023 ; OCHA JIAF accessed 10/08/2024 ; OCHA HDX accessed 15/04/2024,Low,3,"The severity of needs is calculated by cross-checking the number of PiN in each admin 2 provided by the HNRP data on OCHA HDX (last updated on 22 December 2023) with the admin 2 with the highest severity according to OCHA JIAF dashboard.

This approach assumes that the whole population in a certain analysis unit is at the same level of severity. 

The remaining PiN that are not in Level 5 or Level 4 were assigned to Level 3. This is the same number as PiN in the 162 subdistricts that had a severity categorization of “Sever” at Level 3 in addition to the two subdistricts at “Stressed” Level 2. The PiN in those districts were assigned to Level 3. 

“The Distribution of People in Need by Governorate and Severity by Sub-District” map on page 39 in HNO 2024 was used to allocate those sub districts. 

Even though HNO 2024 provide severity level per sub districts, it doesn’t provide the number of PiN within those sub districts. Instead, HNO 2024 provides PiN per governorate. 

To estimate the PiN per sub district, the Food Security PiN per sub district that is provided by the Food Security Cluster was used to extrapolate those numbers.

This is done by taking the percentage of Food Security PiN for each sub district out of the whole governorate, then multiply this percentage by the PiN per governorate provided by HNO 2024 to get an estimate of PiN for each sub district.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%). Thus, the PiN estimate for “Atareb” will be 6.706% of the 3,505,148 PiN in Aleppo, which equals 234,844, which will all be placed at Level 4.

The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit and assume the multisectorial PiN per sub district is proportional to the Food Security PiN.

This approach assumes that the whole population in a certain analysis unit is at the same level of severity. 

The remaining PiN that are not in Level 5 or Level 4 were assigned to Level 3. This is the same number as PiN in the 162 subdistricts that had a severity categorization of “Sever” at Level 3 in addition to the two subdistricts at “Stressed” Level 2. The PiN in those districts were assigned to Level 3. 

“The Distribution of People in Need by Governorate and Severity by Sub-District” map on page 39 in HNO 2024 was used to allocate those sub districts. 

Even though HNO 2024 provide severity level per sub districts, it doesn’t provide the number of PiN within those sub districts. Instead, HNO 2024 provides PiN per governorate. 

To estimate the PiN per sub district, the Food Security PiN per sub district that is provided by the Food Security Cluster was used to extrapolate those numbers.

This is done by taking the percentage of Food Security PiN for each sub district out of the whole governorate, then multiply this percentage by the PiN per governorate provided by HNO 2024 to get an estimate of PiN for each sub district.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%).

The host community was included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

PiN and severity figures are multi-sectoral and equal L5 + L4 + L3

There is around 3,332,896 Syrian refugges in Turkiye according to 3RP. According to IFRC and TRC's Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye, 2% of the refugees are in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% of the refugees are in Extreme Level (L4); 39% of the refugees are in Sever Level (L3), 41% of the refugees are in stressed Level (L2), and 2% of the refugees are in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are around 3,607,620 according to 3RP. The WB national poverty line was used. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023.

The host community is included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

There are no reliable estimate for the severity levels for the mixed migrants in Turkiye. We assume the conditions for the mixed migration in Turkkiye are similar somehow to that of the Syrian refugees. As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 315,702 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to IOM. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (341,725) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023.

The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023. All 14.4% have been placed at Level 3.
