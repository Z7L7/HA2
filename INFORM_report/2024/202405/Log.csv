People affected is calculated according to such estimations (8.4 million plus 2.9 million). In addition to this, in this figure is also taken the total number of people affected by Venezuelan migration (14 976 405). ""To estimate the total number of people affected we are using the population of cities were at least 100,000 Venezuelans live permanently. The cut-off of 100,000 is made by copying the highest level that Migración Colombia has for August 2023. The total population is taken from the DANE Colombia projection for 2024 (Open Excel document in the link provided called poblacion municipal por area, 2020-2035).

In this case, it would be the cities of (including the national capital): Bogotá D.C (7,929,539), Medellín (2,616,335), Cúcuta (812176), Barranquilla (1,334,509) and Cali (2,283,846), resulting in 14,976,405 affected. 

The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

The number of people in need is intersectoral. 

The needs are driven by the conflict that has been going since 2011 and has led to one of the largest displacement crises in the world. The conflict has also contributed to the deterioration of the country’s economy, especially from late 2019 as a result of the combined impacts of US sanctions, COVID-19, and the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon.

The three major earthquakes that hit southeastern Türkiye and northwestern Syria in February 2023, affecting 8.8 million people in Syria alone, aggravating the existing humanitarian crisis. Further collapse of the Syrian Lira and suspension of WFP food distribution further contributed to both the increase of number of PiN and the severity of humanitarian conditions. The security situation in Syria witnessed significant deterioration in the past year as well.

This approach assumes that the whole population in a certain analysis unit is at the same level of severity. 

The remaining PiN that are not in Level 5 or Level 4 were assigned to Level 3. This is the same number as PiN in the 162 subdistricts that had a severity categorization of “Sever” at Level 3 in addition to the two subdistricts at “Stressed” Level 2. The PiN in those districts were assigned to Level 3. 

“The Distribution of People in Need by Governorate and Severity by Sub-District” map on page 39 in HNO 2024 was used to allocate those sub districts. 

Even though HNO 2024 provide severity level per sub districts, it doesn’t provide the number of PiN within those sub districts. Instead, HNO 2024 provides PiN per governorate. 

To estimate the PiN per sub district, the Food Security PiN per sub district that is provided by the Food Security Cluster was used to extrapolate those numbers.

This is done by taking the percentage of Food Security PiN for each sub district out of the whole governorate, then multiply this percentage by the PiN per governorate provided by HNO 2024 to get an estimate of PiN for each sub district.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%). Thus, the PiN estimate for “Atareb” will be 6.706% of the 3,505,148 PiN in Aleppo, which equals 234,844, which will all be placed at Level 4.

The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit and assume the multisectorial PiN per sub district is proportional to the Food Security PiN. Furthermore, this approach risks creating a disproportionally high Level 3 and skewing the distribution.

The new methodology for 2024 decreased Level 3 from 50.8% to 36.6%, mainly from people moving from Level 3 to Level 4.

The host community is included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

PiN and severity figures are multi-sectoral and equal L5 + L4 + L3

There is around 3,332,896 Syrian refugees in Turkiye according to 3RP.

For the host community, there are around 3,607,620 according to 3RP. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023. All 14.4% have been placed at Level 3.

There are no reliable estimate for the severity levels for the mixed migrants in Turkiye. We assume the conditions for the mixed migration in Turkkiye are similar somehow to that of the Syrian refugees. As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 320,000 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to 3RP. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (346,377) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023.

The host community is included because refugee makes a significant percentage of the population, and the crisis had put pressure on health, education, and other social services for a population that already experience high vulnerabilities, resulting in humanitarian needs for the host community.

There are no reliable estimate for the severity levels for the mixed migrants in Turkiye. We assume the conditions for the mixed migration in Turkkiye are similar somehow to that of the Syrian refugees. As such, the severity breakdown of the syrian refugees crisis was applied to the mixed migration as an estimate.

There is around 320,000 mixed migrants in Turkiye according to 3RP. Using the Syrian reugees severity breakdown using IFRC and TRC's ""Intersectoral vulnerability study round 2 - 2022: Living on bare minimum: an exploration of the vulnerability of refugees in Türkiye"", 2% are placed in Catastrophic Level (L5); 16% are placed in Extreme Level (L4); 39% are placed in Sever Level (L3), 41% are placed in stressed Level (L2), and 2% are placed in Minimal Level (L1).

For the host community, there are no reliable estimate for the host community numbers. We assume the the impact of the mixed migration on the host community would be somehow similar to the impact of the refugee crisis. As such, the host community number (346,377) was extrapolated using the same ratio of refugees to host community in the Syrian refugee crisis. The WB national poverty line was used to determine the portion of host community in need. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023. All 14.4% have been placed at Level 3.

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5 for each state/region. For this crisis, the entire country is considered to be the affected area,

In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases instead of three (which was the case in HNO 2023 and corresponded well to INFORM Severity Index’s humanitarian conditions). Different conversions (allocating the five phases to the three levels, Level 3 to 5, in INFORM Severity Index) were conducted but the computed levels do not appropriately represent the context and dynamics in Myanmar. 

The severity phase estimates provided by the HNRP 2024 does not portray the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit accurately. In the case of Myanmar, each township (admin level 3) has been assigned a specific severity level. It is highly unlikely that all the people in a township faces the same severity level given the diversity of needs resulting from various factors such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic features, access to services, etc. That is why the phases in HNRP 2024 does not correspond to the levels of humanitarian conditions in the INFORM Severity Index. 

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, these PIN figures are considered for SI. 

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the SI humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = ((Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024)) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

Given the context and dynamics, there could be people facing humanitarian condition level 5 in some states/regions So, we are assigning InfoGap to Level 5.",MMR001People in Need,2024-05-27,Change in the data/methodology

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5. 

In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases instead of three (which was the case in HNO 2023 and corresponded well to INFORM Severity Index’s humanitarian conditions). Different conversions (allocating the five phases to the three levels, Level 3 to 5, in INFORM Severity Index) were conducted but the computed levels do not appropriately represent the context and dynamics in Myanmar. 

The severity phase estimates provided by the HNRP 2024 does not portray the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit accurately. In the case of Myanmar, each township (admin level 3) has been assigned a specific severity level. It is highly unlikely that all the people in a township faces the same severity level given the diversity of needs resulting from various factors such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic features, access to services, etc. That is why the phases in HNRP 2024 does not correspond to the levels of humanitarian conditions in the INFORM Severity Index. 

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, these PIN figures are considered for SI. 

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the SI humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = (Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

For this crisis, the state considered is the Rakhine state as it is the affected state.

","PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5. 

In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases instead of three (which was the case in HNO 2023 and corresponded well to INFORM Severity Index’s humanitarian conditions). Different conversions (allocating the five phases to the three levels, Level 3 to 5, in INFORM Severity Index) were conducted but the computed levels do not appropriately represent the context and dynamics in Myanmar. 

The severity phase estimates provided by the HNRP 2024 does not portray the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit accurately. In the case of Myanmar, each township (admin level 3) has been assigned a specific severity level. It is highly unlikely that all the people in a township faces the same severity level given the diversity of needs resulting from various factors such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic features, access to services, etc. That is why the phases in HNRP 2024 does not correspond to the levels of humanitarian conditions in the INFORM Severity Index. 

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, these PIN figures are considered for SI. 

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the SI humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = (Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

For this crisis, the states considered are Kachin and Shan (North) states as they are the affected states.

Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, these PIN figures are considered for SI. 

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the SI humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = (Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

Here is the calculation for Rakhine state:
Rakhine state’s PIN according to HNRP 2024 is 1,678,000. For clarification, from the HNRP 2024 PIN by severity phase and location document, we can do the following calculation for the PIN: 166,000 + 254,000 + 647,000 + 31,000 + 83,000 + 255,000 + 223,000 + 19,000 = 1,678,000. Next, the percentages will be obtained from HNO 2023 (page 83). Phase 3 has 434,000 people, Phase 4 has 1,238,000 people, Phase 5 has 0 people, and the PIN is 1,672,000. So, the percentage of phase 3 in PIN for Rakhine (HNO 2023) is 100*(434,000/1,672,000) = ~26%. Percentage for phase 4 is 100*(1,238,000/1,672,000) = ~74% (also could have been found by 100 - 26 = 74). Now, these percentages will be applied to the PIN for 2024 to get the severity levels for 2024 SI. So, level 3 of SI = 1,678,000*~26% = 435,557. For level 4, it is 1,678,000*~74% = 1,242,443. For level 5, it is 1,678,000*0% = 0. This is how each state/region’s severity levels are calculated. 

For this crisis, all the states/regions are considered, except Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan (North) states whcih are considered in the pre-coup crises - MMR002 and MMR003. This way the context is more appropriately captured and double counting is avoided.

","In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases instead of three (which was the case in HNO 2023 and corresponded well to INFORM Severity Index’s humanitarian conditions).

Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Household Hunger Score (HHS) were used to determine the level of humanitarian conditions. REACH Cross-Cutting Needs Assessment (CCNA) Key Multi-Sectoral Findings (January 2024) for this purpose. 

Based on HNO methodology, Borderline consumption FCS 28.5> - > 42.5 (regardless of HHS score) are placed on L3, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 are placed at L4, Poor consumption FCS =<28.5 and sever HHS at L5.

According to REACH assessment, 1% had borderline FCS and are placed at L3, 0.5% had poor FCS with no sever HHS and are placed at L4, no sever HHS and 0% at L5.

This is a significant change from April numbers due to change of methodology and sources that depended on the last issued HNO in 2022. These changes are in alignment of the new development in the country. Iraq witnessed a significant improvement in the security situation and economic situation. The defeat of ISIS in 2019 and the elections of 2021, coupled with sufficient state revenue in 2022 and 2023 from oil exports, improved political stability in the country and allowed the Government to enhance basic service delivery.

For the host community, UNHCR's 3RP 2023 numbers were used instead of 2024 as they show significant jump with no explanation for the change in numbers (2,700,000 compared to 520,000). Latest developments do not support the unexplained significant jump in 3RP 2024 and as such 3RP 2023 number for host community was used instead.
