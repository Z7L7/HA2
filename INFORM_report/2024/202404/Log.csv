The number of people in need is intersectoral. 

The needs are driven by the conflict that has been going since 2011 and has led to one of the largest displacement crises in the world. The conflict has also contributed to the deterioration of the country’s economy, especially from late 2019 as a result of the combined impacts of US sanctions, COVID-19, and the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon.

The three major earthquakes that hit southeastern Türkiye and northwestern Syria in February 2023, affecting 8.8 million people in Syria alone, aggravating the existing humanitarian crisis. Further collapse of the Syrian Lira and suspension of WFP food distribution further contributed to both the increase of number of PiN and the severity of humanitarian conditions.

This approach assumes that the whole population in a certain analysis unit is at the same level of severity. 

The remaining PiN that are not in Level 5 or Level 4 were assigned to Level 3. This is the same number as PiN in the 162 subdistricts that had a severity categorization of “Sever” at Level 3 in addition to the two subdistricts at “Stressed” Level 2. The PiN in those districts were assigned to Level 3. 

“The Distribution of People in Need by Governorate and Severity by Sub-District” map on page 39 in HNO 2024 was used to allocate those sub districts. 

Even though HNO 2024 provide severity level per sub districts, it doesn’t provide the number of PiN within those sub districts. Instead, HNO 2024 provides PiN per governorate. 

To estimate the PiN per sub district, the Food Security PiN per sub district that is provided by the Food Security Cluster was used to extrapolate those numbers.

This is done by taking the percentage of Food Security PiN for each sub district out of the whole governorate, then multiply this percentage by the PiN per governorate provided by HNO 2024 to get an estimate of PiN for each sub district.

For example, according to the area severity provided by HNO 2024, “Atareb” sub district in Aleppo governorate had a severity of Level 4. To estimate the PiN in “Atareb” who all will be placed in Level 4, we multiplied the PiN in Aleppo provided by HNO 2024 (3,505,148) with the percentage “Atareb” makes up of the total Food Security PiN provided by the Food Security Cluster (214,047/3,191,947 = 6.706%). Thus, the PiN estimate for “Atareb” will be 6.706% of the 3,505,148 PiN in Aleppo, which equals 234,844, which will all be placed at Level 4.

The reliability of this data point is set to low as the calculation used to obtain the number comes from ACAPS interpretation of JIAF figures of severity-per-analysis unit, which does not consider the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit and assume the multisectorial PiN per sub district is proportional to the Food Security PiN. Furthermore, this approach risks creating a disproportionally high Level 3 and skewing the distribution.

The new methodology for 2024 decreased Level 3 from 50.8% to 36.6%, mainly from people moving from Level 3 to Level 4.

The reason to estimate the people affected by using the population of cities (instead of whole departments) where the number of Venezuelans is above 100,000 is because we consider that this concentration of migrants in a smaller area (city vs department) increases the risk that the total population in the area, is not only exposed to, but also affected by, the migrations flows.  

The number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees is not added to the population for each department since it is believed to be already included in the HNO 2024 population and PIN estimates.

In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases instead of three (which was the case in HNO 2023 and corresponded well to INFORM Severity Index’s humanitarian conditions). Different conversions (allocating the five phases to the three levels, Level 3 to 5, in INFORM Severity Index) were conducted but the computed levels do not appropriately represent the context and dynamics in Myanmar.

","In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases instead of three (which was the case in HNO 2023 and corresponded well to INFORM Severity Index’s humanitarian conditions). Different conversions (allocating the five phases to the three levels, Level 3 to 5, in INFORM Severity Index) were conducted but the computed levels do not appropriately represent the context and dynamics in Myanmar. 

The severity phase estimates provided by the HNRP 2024 does not portray the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit accurately. In the case of Myanmar, each township (admin level 3) has been assigned a specific severity level. It is highly unlikely that all the people in a township faces the same severity level given the diversity of needs resulting from various factors such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic features, access to services, etc. That is why the phases in HNRP 2024 does not correspond to the levels of humanitarian conditions in the INFORM Severity Index. 

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, these PIN figures are considered for SI. 

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the SI humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = (Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5.

","As per methodology, Level 2 = Affected population - PIN.

It is to be noted that this crisis' (MMR004) Level 2 figure is higher than MMR001's (which is the aggregate of all the crises-MMR002, MMR003, and MMR004) Level 2 figure. This is because MMR004 also affects people who are in need in Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan (North) states. These states are considered in the pre-coup crises - MMR002 and MMR003.

","In HNRP 2024, the PIN is distributed among five phases instead of three (which was the case in HNO 2023 and corresponded well to INFORM Severity Index’s humanitarian conditions). Different conversions (allocating the five phases to the three levels, Level 3 to 5, in INFORM Severity Index) were conducted but the computed levels do not appropriately represent the context and dynamics in Myanmar. 

The severity phase estimates provided by the HNRP 2024 does not portray the diversity of severity of needs within the same unit accurately. In the case of Myanmar, each township (admin level 3) has been assigned a specific severity level. It is highly unlikely that all the people in a township faces the same severity level given the diversity of needs resulting from various factors such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic features, access to services, etc. That is why the phases in HNRP 2024 does not correspond to the levels of humanitarian conditions in the INFORM Severity Index. 

The situation in the country has worsened since the HNO 2023 was published. Based on the context and dynamics, the total PIN (an increase by around one million compared to HNO 2023) and PIN in each state/region in the HNRP 2024 are reasonable estimates. So, these PIN figures are considered for SI. 

The HNO 2023 provides severity phase figures that were equivalent to the SI humanitarian condition levels. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of PIN among the phases in HNO 2023 is a suitable distribution for 2024 as well. So, we compute the figures for Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions by applying the fractions of the phases 3, 4, and 5 in total PIN in HNO 2023, respectively, to the state/region wise PIN in HNRP 2024 to get the Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 humanitarian conditions figures for each state/region. For example, the formula for Level 3 is Level 3 = (Level 3 2023)*(PIN in HNRP 2024) / (PIN in HNO 2023).

PIN = Level 3 + Level 4 + Level 5. 

For this crisis, all the states/regions are considered, except Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan (North) states whcih are considered in the pre-coup crises - MMR002 and MMR003. This way the context is more appropriately captured and double counting is avoided.

","PiN = Syrian refugees in need per 3RP 2024 + Host community in need per 3RP 2023. 

3rp 2024 doesn’t specify humanitarian conditions level for Syrian refugees. Thus, for humanitarian conditions, CARI food insecurity indicators by WFP for 2023 Q1 were used. The food insecurity of refugees in host community were used as the majority of the Syrian refugees reside outside the camps.

Per WFP CARI, 2% of Syrian refugees in host community are severely food insecure, 61% moderately insecure, 37% food insecure. 

For the SI, an adjustment is made to place the 0% at Level 5, the 2% who have borderline consumption at Level 4, 61% at Level 3. 

For the host community, UNHCR's 3RP 2023 numbers were used in stead of 2024 as they show significant jump with no explanation for the change in numbers. Per 3RP 2023, 520,000 million of the host communities are in need. For the SI, all of them were placed at Level 3.",JOR002Extreme humanitarian conditions - Level 5,2024-04-30,Humanitarian development

Syrian refugee crisis:
People in need were estimated using the poverty line for refugees as well as for the host community. For the refugees, the WFP's Comprehensive Vulnerability Monitoring Exercise (CVME) from 2020 was used. This is an underestimation since the economic situation in Türkiye experienced shocks since 2020. According to the CVME around 42% fell below the poverty line, while 7% fell below the extreme poverty line. For the host community, the WB national poverty line was used. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023.
-----
Mixed migration crisis:
People in need were estimated using the poverty lines for migrants as well as for the host community. For the migrants in need, the number was extrapolated from the poverty line of Syrian refugees as a proxy estimate. This is an underestimate as non-Syrian refugees and asylum seekers are assumed to be more vulnerable than most Syrian refugees as they tend to have less access to protection and basic services. The poverty line proxy used for non-Syrian refugees and asylum seekers is from WFP's Comprehensive Vulnerability Monitoring Exercise (CVME) from 2020. This is also an underestimation since the economic situation in Türkiye experienced shocks since 2020. According to the CVME around 42% fell below the poverty line, while 7% fell below the extreme poverty line. For the host community in need, the WB national poverty line was used. According to the WB, around 14.4% fell below the poverty line in 2023.

Kurdish conflict crisis:
The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the kurdish conflict is unknown, but expected to be high. Affected regions of southeastern Turkey have been subjected to decades of violence, which has deeply affected many aspects of life. Large numbers of people remain in a situation of protracted displacement, though their specific needs are not known.

Earthquake crisis:
Low reliability estimation using food security indicator was used. For PiN, the people targeted for food assistance activities by WFP for the EQ response was used as a proxy for PiN. All have been placed on Level three as a conservative estimate for the lack of reliable assessments on the humanitarian conditions and people of needs specifically for people displaced by the earthquake. These needs are driven by the impact of the earthquakes, which affecting over nine million people and causing humanitarian needs. The earthquakes killed over 50,000 people, injured more than 107,000, and severely damaged buildings and infrastructure in southeastern Türkiye.

Syrian refugee crisis:
For estimating moderate humanitarian condition levels, WFP's Comprehensive Vulnerability Monitoring Exercise (CVME) from 2020 was used. This is an underestimation since the economic situation in Türkiye experienced multiple shocks since 2020. According to the CVME, around 42% of refugees live below the poverty line but above the extreme poverty line. These are refugees are assumed to have moderate needs. For host community, the poverty line by the WB for 2023 was used. According to the WB, 14.4% for host community live under the poverty line. Those host community were assumed to have moderate needs.
-----
Mixed migration crisis:
To estimate the number of moderate humanitarian conditions level for migrants, we extrapolated from the poverty line for Syrian refugees as a proxy estimate. This is an underestimate as non-Syrian refugees and asylum seekers are assumed to be more vulnerable than most Syrian refugees because they tend to have less access to protection and basic services. The poverty line proxy used for non-Syrian refugees and asylum seekers is from WFP's Comprehensive Vulnerability Monitoring Exercise (CVME) from 2020. This is also an underestimation since the economic situation in Türkiye experienced shocks since 2020. According to the CVME around 42% fell below the poverty line but above the extreme poverty line. Those were considered to have moderate humanitarian conditions. For the host community, the World Bank poverty line was used. According to the WB, around 14.4% fall below poverty line. All were placed under L3.
