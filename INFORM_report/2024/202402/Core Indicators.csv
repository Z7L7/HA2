Per WFP CARI, 2% of Syrian refugees in host community are severely food insecure, 61% moderately insecure, 37% food insecure. 

For the SI, an adjustment is made to place the 0% at Level 5, the 2% who have borderline consumption at Level 4, 61% at Level 3. 
For the host community, UNHCR's 3RP 2023 numbers were used in stead of 2024 as they show significant jump with no explanation for the change in numbers. Per 3RP 2023, 520,000 million of the host communities are in need.

To estimate the humanitarian conditions for the SI, we are applying IPC of food security phase classification of Ma’rib as it is the most sever classification in Yemen and because similarity as Ma’rib sever humanitarian condition is partially driven by the huge IDPs whose humanitarian condition would more resemble the conditions of migrants relatively compared to host community.

Thus, the percentages of IPC Ph 5 and Ph 4 were used to multiply by the people affected to get L5, Ph3 to get L4, Ph2 at L3. This means 20% of affected were paced in L5, 39% in L4, and 20% in L3. 

This is a conservative under estimation as it only takes food security aspect in determining the humanitarian condition instead of a multi-sectorial humanitarian conditions.
