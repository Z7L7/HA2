Therefore, the PIN as per the revised HNP (7 million), the number of people who are most vulnerable among the PIN as per the revised HNP (3.4 million), and the number of people graduating from moderately severe food insecurity (2.4 million) were used to estimate the PIN's severity levels.

The decrease in number of moderately acute food insecure people is 2.4 million.

The IPC figures are restricted to three provinces (Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). The COVID-19 precautionary measure has had a devastating impact on the economy and people living below the poverty. and The monsoon had affected an estimated 33 million people across Pakistan by end of August. This crisis now covers 6 provinces up from 3, and Balochistan province remains the most affected. 
For estimating the number of people affected we considered the Number of people living below the poverty line (World Bank data), across the whole of Pakistan. As the world Bank data in based on the whole country, we considered the flood affected people to be included here. (Not including the NRP anymore as that's outdated data before the flood and not considering IPC to avoid double counting).

","The total number of PIN equals to the sum of the number of people in the country facing moderate or severe chronic food insecurity (except for the Rohingya refugees and host population in the Rohingya refugee crisis); the number of Rohingya refugees as per the latest estimates provided by the Goct. Bangladesh and UNHCR; and the number of host community population as per the JRP 2023.

For districts that have the 2023 acute food insecurity data, IPC acute food insecurity phase 3 (crisis) and phase 4 (emergency) data (May - Sept 2023 projections) were used instead of IPC chronic food insecurity level 3 (moderate) and level 4 (severe) data, respectively. The population in need in the floods crisis in Chattogram and Cyclone Hamoon crisis in Chattogram and Cox's Bazar districts, given their profile, are not added here as they are considered to be facing moderate or severe chronic food insecurity and including them would result in significant double counting.

Therefore, 
PIN = number of people facing moderate or severe chronic food insecurity/crisis or emergency phase acute food insecurity (except Rohingya refugees and host community population in the Rohingya refugees crisis) + number of Rohingya refugees as per the latest estimates provided by the Govt. Bangladesh and UNHCR + number of host community population as per the JRP 2023 = 36,046,398 + 965,467+ 537,900 = 37,549,765

Sources used for the PIN: IPC 15/06/2022, IPC 01/06/2023, ISCG et al. 07/03/2023, latest estimates for the number of Rohingya refugees by the Govt. Bangladesh and the UNHCR

An alternative measure for PIN is people living under the poverty line. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2022 published by the BBS, the poverty rate is 18.7% which is around 32 million people. This figure is also close to the 38 million and is expected to be the case as food insecurity in Bangladesh is a consequence of poverty, especially when food availability itself is not the major factor for food insecurity. However, IPC provides levels/phases that can be used to distribute people in need among severity index severity levels, so IPC data is used for calculation of the PIN.

Complex crisis background:
The complex crisis in Bangladesh is marked by many drivers, including high recurrence of natural hazards such as flash and monsoon floods, cyclones, riverbank erosion, and dry spells; unsustainable livelihoods (unskilled day labour, marginal farming or fishing that often generate inadequate and unpredictable income); low levels of physical, financial, and human capital; vulnerability to shocks and loss of employment, especially in agriculture sector; lack of access to education for the poorest; mistargeting of social safety net programmes due to various issues such as corruption, favouritism, nepotism, and political pressure; post-pandemic situation and the conflict in Ukraine; economic issues such as high food prices, persistent high inflation rates, depreciation of the local currency, and low foreign currency reserves; epidemic (e.g., dengue); and displacement.",BGD010People in Need,2023-12-27,Humanitarian development
