The host population in Cox’s Bazar is considered to be affected by the influx of Rohingya that occurred after September 2017 (Level 2). The PIN includes the Rohingya refugee population living in Cox’s Bazar as of February 2020. There was a significant decrease in the number of refugees with the publication of the 2020 Joint Humanitarian Response Plan - this was due largely to a change in registration process that identified host community members that registered as refugees to receive aid distributions, marking a sharp decrease in the number of refugees. According to Multi-Sector Needs Assessments from the ISCG, the Joint Humanitarian Response Plan, Settlement and Protection Profiling by UNHCR and REACH, and ACAPS’ analysis on vulnerability within Rohingya camps, there are specific groups that are more likely to face additional challenges in accessing humanitarian assistance. These groups include those living in female-headed households (134,428), elderly (30,026), unaccompanied or separated children (8,596), and individuals with a physical disability (34,196). Challenges include physically accessing food distribution, medical care, or income-generating opportunities (social hierarchies, hilly and unstable terrain, long distances), as well as increased risk of security incidents such as robbery or assault – particularly in Teknaf camps. Thus, this population is classified as Level 4 as they are assumed to have a more severe need than other groups within the camp population. All remaining refugees are placed on Level 3 severity. Where necessary, vulnerable population is calculated based on HH size and number of families, with the assumption that the average household size is 4. Thus, vulnerable population (Level 4) is estimated to be 207,246.  Due to the provision of humanitarian aid and an active international response, it is assumed that no Rohingya living in the camps are experiencing severity Level 5 humanitarian conditions.

",Low,3,"Eritrea is characterized by harsh climatic conditions, exacerbating the vulnerability of communities. In recent years, the country’s climatic conditions have tested the coping capacities of the population, which is largely dependent (80%) on subsistence agriculture. Slower economic growth and the residual effects of war also perpetuate the vulnerability of approximately 66% of the population. The country is governed by a one-party state, human rights are systematically repressed, extrajudicial killings are reported, and elections have not been held since 1993. It is therefore considered that the whole population is affected by this complex crisis. The number also includes those displaced (refugees in Eritrea and Eritreans outside of country) and minus 10,000 estimated to be internally displaced in Eritrea as they would be already counted in the total population in country.

",Medium,2,"There is no clear figure about the number of people in need in Jordan. However, in the Regional Strategic Overview 2021-2022, More than 800,000 Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians are targeted to receive food assistance through cash-based transfers in 2020. Additionally, 78% of the population are highly or severely vulnerable, living below the Jordanian poverty line and Nearly 55% of the population are identified as severely vulnerable and 40% as highly vulnerable, 95% in total  based on the Vulnerability Assessment Framework conducted in 2019. Moreover, there is no severe food insecurity in the sample. 13% were moderately food
insecure and 67% were marginally food secure. But these figures only represtent the Syrian refugees residing in urban, peri-urban and rural settings, but excludes those living in refugee camps. In the 2018 Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF) highlighted that about half of Syrian households have severe or high health vulnerability. Moreover, in Jordan, 78% of Syrian refugees outside camps live below Jordanian poverty line, according to the UN; and almost 6 in 10 Syrian refugees of working age are unemployed. The majority of Syrian families rely on humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs at a time of aid cuts and economic downturn. As a result, many families are forced to miss meals or spend less on healthcare. 
Vulnerable Jordanians are also might be in need, but a definitive figure for tihs category was not found as well.

In Bangladesh, there is no population that is simply considered to be only exposed. Level 2 includes all people directly affected by the conflict in Rakhine / Rohingya refugee influx. In Rakhine, this is the population of townships where PIN are located (805,162 people). This is based on the assumption that anyone living in townships where there are PIN is likely to be experience direct humanitarian consequences from the conflict.  In Bangladesh, this number includes the host population (471,768). The host population in Cox’s Bazar is considered to be affected by the influx of Rohingya that occurred after September 2017. The PIN includes all people in need in Rakhine state and all Rohingya refugees. In Rakhine, the PIN is calculated using HNO severity data. Level 3 includes all PIN considered to be in stressed and severe conditions (HNO level 2 and 3). In Bangladesh, this includes all refugees that are not classified as particularly vulnerable or experiencing additional needs (647,549). Level 4 in Rakhine includes all those placed in level 4 severity in the HNO as it is considered equal to ACAPS severity methodolody. Level 4 in Bangladesh includes vulnerable populations of refugees (207,246). According to Multi-Sector Needs Assessments from the ISCG, the Joint Humanitarian Response Plan, Settlement and Protection Profiling by UNHCR and REACH, and ACAPS’ analysis on vulnerability within Rohingya camps, there are specific groups that are more likely to face additional challenges in accessing humanitarian assistance. These groups include those living in female-headed households, elderly, unaccompanied or separated children, and individuals with a physical disability. Challenges include physically accessing food distribution, medical care, or income-generating opportunities (social hierarchies, hilly and unstable terrain, long distances), as well as increased risk of security incidents such as robbery or assault – particularly in Teknaf camps. Thus, this population is classified as Level 4 as they are assumed to have a more severe need than other groups within the camp population. According to the new HNO 2021, 150,000 non-displaced Rohingya in Rakhine are facing extreme humanitarian needs.
