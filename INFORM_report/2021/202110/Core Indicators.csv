",Low,3,"Eritrea is characterized by harsh climatic conditions, exacerbating the vulnerability of communities. In recent years, the country’s climatic conditions have tested the coping capacities of the population, which is largely dependent (80%) on subsistence agriculture. Slower economic growth and the residual effects of war also perpetuate the vulnerability of approximately 66% of the population. The country is governed by a one-party state, human rights are systematically repressed, extrajudicial killings are reported, and elections have not been held since 1993. It is therefore considered that the whole population is affected by this complex crisis. The number also includes those displaced (refugees in Eritrea and Eritreans outside of country) and minus 10,000 estimated to be internally displaced in Eritrea as they would be already counted in the total population in country.

According to recent monitoring in Gaza Strip - About 25% reported that their homes were fully destroyed, therefore, they were considered in Level 5, the remaining were distributed between Level 4 (60%) and Level 3 (40%). 
While in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem - About 883,000 live in vulnerable areas (448k Area A&B, 312k Area C, 86k East Jerusalem, 37k H2) and therefore, they were considered in Level 5, the remaining were distributed between Level 4 (60%) and Level 3 (40%). 
The total population is considered facing at least minor humanitarian conditions. The entire population (5.2) are considered exposed = affected.

Level 1 takes into consideration the people exposed to Venezuelan inlux minus people affected and people in need Level 3 includes the Venezuelans with intention to stay, the Colombian returnees and the host communities 
Level 4 includes the refugees and migrants in transit. 


PER: The latest Regional Response Plan 2021 estimates that 735,000 refugees and migrants from Venezuela and 500,000 members of the host communities in the country will be in need of some sort of humanitarian assistance. No other data on the current impact on hosting communities is available. It is estimated that the rest is able to meet their needs by applying (sometimes unsustainable) coping strategies. The remaining population living in the most affected regions of the country are considered to be affected and in Level 1.

T&T: most recent estimate of 30,800 Venezuelans in T&T from RMRP (used as PIN number, level 3). While Venezuelans present in the country likley add a strain to resources/services, the impact on the host community in terms of humanitarian needs seems to be low. They are placed in Level 1.
