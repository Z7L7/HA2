This includes all people exposed to the conflict, which is considered to be the entire population of Rakhine state and Paletwa township in Chin state, minus those directly affected or people in need (2,318,411). In Bangladesh, there is no population that is simply considered to be only exposed. Level 2 includes all people directly affected by the conflict in Rakhine / Rohingya refugee influx. In Rakhine, this is the population of townships where PIN are located (805,162 people). This is based on the assumption that anyone living in townships where there are PIN is likely to be experience direct humanitarian consequences from the conflict.  In Bangladesh, this number includes the host population (471,768). The host population in Cox’s Bazar is considered to be affected by the influx of Rohingya that occurred after September 2017. The PIN includes all people in need in Rakhine state and all Rohingya refugees. In Rakhine, the PIN is calculated using HNO severity data. Level 3 includes all PIN considered to be in stressed and severe conditions (HNO level 2 and 3). This is the PIN in Kyaukpyu, Meybon, Pauktaw, Sittwe – (250,322 people). In Bangladesh, this includes all refugees that are not classified as particularly vulnerable or experiencing additional needs (647,549). Level 4 in Rakhine includes all those placed in level 4 severity in the HNO as it is considered equal to ACAPS severity methodolody. This includes all PIN in Kyauktaw, Minbya, Mrauk-U, Ponnagyun, Buthidaung, Maungdaw, and Rathedaung townships in Rakhine and Paletwa township in Chin state (503,965 people). Level 4 in Bangladesh includes vulnerable populations of refugees (207,246). According to Multi-Sector Needs Assessments from the ISCG, the Joint Humanitarian Response Plan, Settlement and Protection Profiling by UNHCR and REACH, and ACAPS’ analysis on vulnerability within Rohingya camps, there are specific groups that are more likely to face additional challenges in accessing humanitarian assistance. These groups include those living in female-headed households, elderly, unaccompanied or separated children, and individuals with a physical disability. Challenges include physically accessing food distribution, medical care, or income-generating opportunities (social hierarchies, hilly and unstable terrain, long distances), as well as increased risk of security incidents such as robbery or assault – particularly in Teknaf camps. Thus, this population is classified as Level 4 as they are assumed to have a more severe need than other groups within the camp population.

The country is governed by a one-party state, human rights are systematically repressed, extrajudicial killings are reported, and elections have not been held since 1993.

There were around 242,000 IDPs in the country as of December 2018, but the figure is based on severely decayed data about people displaced during the country’s civil war. It has not been updated since 1997. Natural hazards and development projects also cause displacement every year. 

As in previous years, no new displacements were recorded for Guatemala in 2018 given the lack of data on people displaced by violence in the country. About 27,000 new displacements associated with natural hazards, however, were recorded, the majority of which were a result of multiple eruptions of the active “Fuego” volcano.

Their needs continue to be assessed and addressed in the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan 2019-2020 (3RP) and are not included in this assessment and analysis of humanitarian needs of Iraqis in Iraq."" p.16

The number of vulnerable Iraqis in host communities which was added to the PIN number and to level 3 within the interntional displacement crisis was subtracted from the country level caculations, as vulnerable Iraqis should alredy be accounted for under HNO data.

Level 4: 9.2% of the PRS population is extremely poor or ""unable to meet essential food requirements"",according to a 2015 study. While the data is old and the number of PRS has dramaticaly decreased, this is still one of the most authoritative sources on poverty assessment of PRS in Lebanon. 55% of registered Syrian refugee households live below the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) of USD 87 per month. After having converted the household figures into number of individuals , the number was added to level 4.

Level 3: 89.1% of the PRS population lives in poverty or is ""unable to meet basic food and non-food needs"", according to a 2015 study. While the data is old and the number of PRS have dramaticaly decreased, this is still one of the most authoritative sources on poverty assessment of PRS in Lebanon. 18% of registered Syrian refugee households live below the Minimum Expenditure Basket of USD 114 per month, but above the SMEB of USD 87 per month.  Household figures were converted into number of individuals.

Level 2: around 10% of the PRS population does not live in poverty,according to a 2015 study. While the data is old and the number of PRS have dramaticaly decreased, this is still one of the most authoritative sources on poverty assessment of PRS in Lebanon. They are still affected by a precarious legal situation and difficult access to services and the labour market. Unregistered Syrians are included as affected population, as not enough information was found to categorise them according to needs, but can still be expected to face hardships. The host population has 1.5 million vulnerable individuals whose precarious situation was exacerbated by the crisis according to the 2020 LCRP. The figure was added to the number of people affected. 9.8% of registered Syrian refugee HHs living between the MEB and 125% MEB were considered affected as they still struggle with higher food prices and unemployment in the current economic crisis.

Level 1: people exposed- need levels 2-5 (including 17.2% of registered Syrian refugee households living above 125% MEB)

Syrian refugees are expected to be affected by the Beirut explosion (04 Aug), as refugees and migrant workers are particularly vulnerable as they have less resources to reconstruct damaged shelters and buy food and essential items.

Level 4: The 2020 HRP identified 134,000 migrants and refugees (86,000 + 48,000) as most vulnerable and currently targeted by humanitarian response. The figure for this level is equivalent to 134,000-3,200 (migrants on level 5, in detention).

Level 3: 324,000 migrants an refugees were identified as in need by the 2020 HRP. The figure above equals 324,000-level 4-level 5.

COL: 500000 - PIN number includes the number of Venezuzelans with the intention to stay (1,630,903) + 500,000 of refugees and migrants in transit + 500,000 colombians returnees + 600,000 of the host communities. 
Level 1 takes into consideration the people exposed to Venezuelan inlux minus people affected and people in need 
Level 3 includes the Venezuelans with intention to stay, the Colombian returnees and the host communities 
Level 4 includes the refugees and migrants in transit. 

PER: 0 - Level 1 takes into account the number of people living in the six provinces where the majority of Venezuelans can be found (Lima, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Piura, Arequipa and Tumbes) minus those estimated to be facing shortages and or availability and accessibility problems regarding basic services due to the crisis, located in Level 3. Considering Peru as a upper-middle income country and current response activities no Venezuelans within the country are expected to face extreme humanitarian needs. 

ECU: 0 - The total population living in the most affected regions of the country are considered to be affected and in Level 1 need. The estimated number of Venezuelan migrant and refugees currently in Ecuador 385,042 and around 209,000 people from the host communites considered to be in need of assitance are placed in Level 3 

TRI:0 - Most sources put the number of Venezuelans at 40,000 but others estimate the actual number to be higher, at 60,000 (used as PIN number and people facing moderate humanitarian conditions, level3). While Venezuelans present in the country likley add a strain to resources/services, the impact on the host community in terms of humanitarian needs seems to be low.
