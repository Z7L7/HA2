INGOs/UN have no access. This number is the latest available information on internally displaced persons (IDPs) because of conflict in west Papua. Previosly the latest information from local observers was 60,000 IDPs by Dec 2021. According to the latest UN source: 'since the escalation of violence in December 2018, the overall number of displaced has grown by 60,000 to 100,000 people. The majority of IDPs have not returned to their homes due to the heavy security force presence and ongoing armed clashes in the conflict areas.” Information on IDP figures in west Papua is not always available on a regular basis, and the UN is considered a reliable source, so although the range is between 60,000 - 100,000, the analyst's interpretation is that the number is likely closer to 100,000 IDPs as this information is newer than the 60,000 IDP figure from Dec 2021 & it is more likely that there is increased displacement by March 2022.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113062,2022-03-08 00:00:00,IDN002Injuries reported,x,x,x,x,No/limited data/information available,x,2019-07-30 00:00:00,IDN002Illness cases reported,x,x,x,x,No/limited data/information available,x,2019-07-30 00:00:00,IDN002Fatalities reported,53,ACLED 31/08/2022,Low,3,Total number of fatalities in the last 6 months in the Papua and West Papua provinces.,https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/,2022-09-23 00:00:00,IDN002Buildings damaged,x,x,x,x,No/limited data/information available,x,2019-07-30 00:00:00,IDN002Buildings destroyed,x,x,x,x,No/limited data/information available,x,2019-07-30 00:00:00,IDN002Buildings in the affected area,,,,,,,,IDN002Economic Losses,x,x,x,x,No/limited data/information available,x,2019-07-30 00:00:00,IDN002People in Need,100000,UN 01/03/2022,Low,3,"This is the same number as the number of displaced people.

This includes all people exposed to the conflict, which is considered to be the entire population of Rakhine state and Paletwa township in Chin state, minus those directly affected or people in need (2,318,411). In Bangladesh, there is no population that is simply considered to be only exposed. Level 2 includes all people directly affected by the conflict in Rakhine / Rohingya refugee influx. In Rakhine, this is the population of townships where PIN are located (805,162 people). This is based on the assumption that anyone living in townships where there are PIN is likely to be experience direct humanitarian consequences from the conflict.  In Bangladesh, this number includes the host population (471,768). The host population in Cox’s Bazar is considered to be affected by the influx of Rohingya that occurred after September 2017. The PIN includes all people in need in Rakhine state and all Rohingya refugees. In Rakhine, the PIN is calculated using HNO severity data. Level 3 includes all PIN considered to be in stressed and severe conditions (HNO level 2 and 3). In Bangladesh, this includes all refugees that are not classified as particularly vulnerable or experiencing additional needs (647,549). Level 4 in Rakhine includes all those placed in level 4 severity in the HNO as it is considered equal to ACAPS severity methodolody. Level 4 in Bangladesh includes vulnerable populations of refugees (207,246). According to Multi-Sector Needs Assessments from the ISCG, the Joint Humanitarian Response Plan, Settlement and Protection Profiling by UNHCR and REACH, and ACAPS’ analysis on vulnerability within Rohingya camps, there are specific groups that are more likely to face additional challenges in accessing humanitarian assistance. These groups include those living in female-headed households, elderly, unaccompanied or separated children, and individuals with a physical disability. Challenges include physically accessing food distribution, medical care, or income-generating opportunities (social hierarchies, hilly and unstable terrain, long distances), as well as increased risk of security incidents such as robbery or assault – particularly in Teknaf camps. Thus, this population is classified as Level 4 as they are assumed to have a more severe need than other groups within the camp population. According to the new HNO 2021, 150,000 non-displaced Rohingya in Rakhine are facing extreme humanitarian needs.

HC2: 44% of the refugee population in Turkey falls above the poverty line. Syrian refugees who are above the poverty line are considered to be affected by the crisis, but not necessarily have humanitarian needs.
