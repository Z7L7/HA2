",Low,3,"Eritrea is characterized by harsh climatic conditions, exacerbating the vulnerability of communities. In recent years, the country’s climatic conditions have tested the coping capacities of the population, which is largely dependent (80%) on subsistence agriculture. Slower economic growth and the residual effects of war also perpetuate the vulnerability of approximately 66% of the population. The country is governed by a one-party state, human rights are systematically repressed, extrajudicial killings are reported, and elections have not been held since 1993. It is therefore considered that the whole population is affected by this complex crisis. The number also includes those displaced (refugees in Eritrea and Eritreans outside of country) and minus 10,000 estimated to be internally displaced in Eritrea as they would be already counted in the total population in country.

Migrants and refugees in need living in admin level 1 areas on level 4 and 5 are considered as facing restricted access constraints; migrants and refugees in need living in admin level 1 areas on level 2 and 3 are considered as facing limited access constraints. Level 1 areas were not included in the figures. This is a general estimation which does not reflect the specific access challenges per district or distinguish between different categories of migrants and refugees in need. The usage of OCHA level 4 and 5 for restricted access constraints and level 2 and 3 for limited access constraint is also an attempt to translate OCHA's 5 severity levels into ACAPS' two  categories. For these reasons, reliability is set as low for both access indicators as the above figures are most likely an overestimation and no specific figure for migrants and refugees in need affected by access constraints was found.",https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/libya_hno_2020-fullen_final.pdf; https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/access_report_-_april_2020.pdf,2020-07-03 00:00:00,LBY002Impediments to entry into country (bureaucratic and administrative),1,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,LBY002Restriction of movement (impediments to freedom of movement and/or administrative restrictions),3,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,LBY002Interference into implementation of humanitarian activities,0,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,"LBY002Violence against personnel, facilities and assets",0,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,LBY002Denial of existence of humanitarian needs or entitlements to assistance,2,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,LBY002Restriction and obstruction of access to services and assistance,2,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,LBY002Ongoing insecurity/hostilities affecting humanitarian assistance,1,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,LBY002Presence of mines and improvised explosive devices,1,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00,"LBY002Physical constraints in the environment (obstacles related to terrain, climate, lack of infrastructure, etc.)",1,ACAPS Access Methodology,Medium,2,x,x,2021-10-27 00:00:00

This includes all people exposed to the conflict, which is considered to be the entire population of Rakhine state and Paletwa township in Chin state, minus those directly affected or people in need (2,318,411). In Bangladesh, there is no population that is simply considered to be only exposed. Level 2 includes all people directly affected by the conflict in Rakhine / Rohingya refugee influx. In Rakhine, this is the population of townships where PIN are located (805,162 people). This is based on the assumption that anyone living in townships where there are PIN is likely to be experience direct humanitarian consequences from the conflict.  In Bangladesh, this number includes the host population (471,768). The host population in Cox’s Bazar is considered to be affected by the influx of Rohingya that occurred after September 2017. The PIN includes all people in need in Rakhine state and all Rohingya refugees. In Rakhine, the PIN is calculated using HNO severity data. Level 3 includes all PIN considered to be in stressed and severe conditions (HNO level 2 and 3). In Bangladesh, this includes all refugees that are not classified as particularly vulnerable or experiencing additional needs (647,549). Level 4 in Rakhine includes all those placed in level 4 severity in the HNO as it is considered equal to ACAPS severity methodolody. Level 4 in Bangladesh includes vulnerable populations of refugees (207,246). According to Multi-Sector Needs Assessments from the ISCG, the Joint Humanitarian Response Plan, Settlement and Protection Profiling by UNHCR and REACH, and ACAPS’ analysis on vulnerability within Rohingya camps, there are specific groups that are more likely to face additional challenges in accessing humanitarian assistance. These groups include those living in female-headed households, elderly, unaccompanied or separated children, and individuals with a physical disability. Challenges include physically accessing food distribution, medical care, or income-generating opportunities (social hierarchies, hilly and unstable terrain, long distances), as well as increased risk of security incidents such as robbery or assault – particularly in Teknaf camps. Thus, this population is classified as Level 4 as they are assumed to have a more severe need than other groups within the camp population. According to the new HNO 2021, 150,000 non-displaced Rohingya in Rakhine are facing extreme humanitarian needs.
