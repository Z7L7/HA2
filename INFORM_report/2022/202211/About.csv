2,INFORM SEVERITY INDEX
3,December 2021
4,OBJECTIVES AND PROCESS
5,"The INFORM Severity Index summarises a wide range of already existing, quantitative information about crisis severity and presents it in a format that can be used more easily in decision-making. It aggregates information from a range of credible, publicly available sources. Human analysts collect the data and enter it into the Index.

It is intended to contribute to:
      - A shared and objective understanding of crisis severity; 
      - Decisions on the allocation of resources in a way that is proportionate with crisis severity; 
      - Justify and advocate for action, especially in the case of forgotten or unrecognised crises; 
      - Monitor trends in crisis severity over time"
6,ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY
7,"The INFORM Severity Index is a composite indicator that measures the severity of humanitarian crises against a common scale:
It is a composite indicator that aggregates data from various sources to categorise all crises into five levels of severity:
      - Very high (5); High (4); Medium (3); Low (2); Very low (1)

The Index covers:
      - The impact of the crisis itself, in terms of the scope of its geographical, human and physical effects;
      - The conditions and status of the people affected, including information about the distribution of severity (i.e. the number of people in each category of severity within a crisis);
      - The complexity of the crisis, in terms of factors that affect its mitigation or resolution. 

The results are provided by crisis and by country. A crisis is defined as an event and a location. There may be more than one crisis per country. Sometimes a crisis may be defined as a country. It is also possible to access the values for different levels of the analytical framework, to better understand the main drivers of a crisis. All the underlying data, metadata and methodology are publicly available.

9,"DATA SOURCES, USE AND LIMITATIONS"
10,"The INFORM Severity aggregates information from a range of credible, publicly available sources, such as UN agencies, governments and other multilateral organisations. The country’s Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) is used if one is available. 

The INFORM Severity Index can be used to support decisions that require an understanding of the severity of crises globally or to understand changes in crisis severity over time. It should not be used for decisions about the operational response to a specific crisis. Crisis-specific information like needs assessments and appeals should be used to support these decisions.

The INFORM Severity Index is only one source of information that can support decisions about humanitarian crises. It should typically be complemented by other sources. Due to the dynamic and chaotic nature of humanitarian emergencies and the lack of a globally systematic approach to data collection, imperfect information is necessarily used in the Index. Expert judgement is involved in deciding what data to include. A reliability estimate is provided for each crisis. The results spreadsheet contains metadata, showing the sources and dates of included figures, as well as key assessments or judgements made in their inclusion.
